Computer Club is held every Thursday after school in room 232.  
If a meeting has to be moved, an update will be posted with the new date.

If someone is bringing a console, be sure to bring your own controller.  
Club members bringing consoles are not obligated to supply controllers for other members, but is encouraged.
