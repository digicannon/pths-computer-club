Hey everyone, our 3rd meeting will be December 10th.

**Please remember to bring your $10 club fee to this meeting!**

I would like to note that if you would like to bring a console or something of that sort, we have the CRT and the projector available to us, as well as the computers in the lab.  
If you do plan on bringing something to any meeting, please be sure to let others know so we don't have people bringing extra stuff that won't end up being used.
