Just a quick notification that the meeting scheduled for October 29th has been moved up to this Thursday, October 22nd.

In addition, I would like to use this announcement as an opportunity to let everyone know:  
If you have an idea for Computer Club or something you would like to bring in, please do not hesitate to ask.  
Just be sure to let me know in advance so we don't have extra things being brought that won't be used.  We don't need 4 people bringing in consoles, for example.
