An email went out yesterday with an update.  Here is what you need to know:
> I just wanted to inform everyone that Justice will be unable to participate in the P-Rade/Senior Servant auction tomorrow night due to prior family obligations.  
I encourage you to participate in the event but just know that Justice will not be auctioned.
