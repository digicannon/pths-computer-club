I'm looking forward to seeing you all for the first Computer Club meeting tomorrow!

For this meeting I will be bringing a GameCube with Super Smash Bros. Melee.  
All characters/maps are unlocked.  
Please be sure to bring a controller if you plan on participating.  I will be bringing two extras for those who forget, but don't count on using one.

Depending on how many participants we have, we will be conducting a tournament of one of these types:

 * Singles (1v1), single elimination
 * Singles (1v1), double elimination
 * Doubles (2v2), single elimination
 * Doubles (2v2), double elimination

We follow the same ruleset nearly everyone does.  You can view it on Smashboards [here](http://smashboards.com/rulesets/melee/).
